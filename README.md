# RBM_from_Scratch

Authors : Sajjad Mahdavi - Marvin Tordjman - Yanis Fellah 

As part of the Deep Learning II course in the M2 Data Science master at Ecole Polytechnique, we had to implement from scratch a Restricted Boltzmann machine (`RBM`) and a Deep Belief Network (`DBN`) and in a second time to compare the performance of a Fully Connected Network (`FL`) that was initialized randomly and a `FL` that was initialized in an unsupervised way thanks to a DBN

In this project we used AlphaDigits and the MNIST database to evaluate our models.
